# Donuts
Donut with threejs and blender

After building a torus in three.js I wanted to see how the code would work if I had a gltf "donut" instead of the torus inbuilt in threee.js.

I built the donut in blender and then used the exported gltf to import into the file. 


## What I learnt

I learnt a lot about imports in three.js, debugging the import as it would not render at the start. I worked through the issue by first importing a premade gltf file to see if it was my file that was the issue.
Once i had established that the path way correct and the image rendered I replaced the premade file with my own which enables three.js to see my file and render it onscreen.

## What is next

I am finished with this repo as it served the learning experience i was trying to understand. I intend to now take those skills into react three fibre and move my learning forwards from there.
